<p>WHAT WE'RE DOING
    We are changing Memphis with programs that focus on ensuring that students are taught the principles of information
    and computation, how digital systems work, and they learn how to put this knowledge to use through programming and
    software development concepts. CodeCrew programming includes a number of summer camps, after school programs,
    in-school electives classes, internships and special events.
    ​
    Since May 2015, we have taught more than 1,000 students to code through our summer camps, after school programs,
    in-school electives, and special events. Of the 250 kids we serve weekly, 91% are black and latinx youth, 41% are
    girls who code, and overall, 89% of our students are more likely to study computer science.</p>
